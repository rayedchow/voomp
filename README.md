### Hey! 👋

I   go by as "vamp", nicknamed as "voomp" 👦.

I   am a student 📔 and a developer 👨‍💻.

I   don't do many open source projects, but I may do some in the future 💹.

I   am mainly a software developer ©.

I   also do a lot of web development (TS ReactJS) 🕸.



Other things that I do as a developer is robotics, Minecraft plugin development, game development, and more.
